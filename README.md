## Description 📌

        Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019.
        
        E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.
        
        Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.
        
        Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You’ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

        Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. 
        
        You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.


### As a MANAGER,

        ...at an internet retail company
        
        I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
        
        SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

### Criteria

        GIVEN a functional Express.js API
        
        WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
        
        THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
        
        WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
        
        THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
        
        WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
        
        THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
        
        WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
        
        THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
        
        WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
        
        THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database


## Installation 🛠

Be sure to initialize! Start the prompts by running 'node server.js' from the terminal.

[Sequelize Info + Resources](https://gist.github.com/zcaceres/742744b708393c022703b615d1bffbb1)
Sequelize: "Sequelize is a powerful library in Javascript that makes it easy to manage a SQL database. ... At its core, Sequelize is an Object-Relational Mapper – meaning that it maps an object syntax onto our database schemas. Sequelize uses Node. JS and Javascript's object syntax to accomplish its mapping."
